# Intro

This is a node.js project that is part of the [Projects in ExpressJS Video](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/projects-expressjs-video) course published by [Pack publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/)

# Differences

* In the video course the project uses pug as template engine. The code in the repo uses handlebars instead.

* The files were coded manually and not by using express-generator. Mainly as an exercise.
